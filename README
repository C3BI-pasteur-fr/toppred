TOPPRED - Transmembrane topology prediction.

This program is a new implementation of the original toppred program,
based on G. von Heijne algorithm :

"Membrane protein structure prediction. Hydrophobicity analysis and
the positive-inside rule." J Mol Biol 1992 May 20;225(2):487-94.

"TopPred II: an improved software for membrane protein structure
predictions." CABIOS 10(6):685-6, 1994 Dec.

This implementation can use 2 optionals programs in order to 
display graphical results:

	- gnuplot version 3.7 patchlevel 1 or more
            `gnuplot' can be used in order to display the
	    hydrophobicity profile of a given sequence.
	    see <http://www.gnuplot.info/>
	- libgd with png support
	    `gd' library can be used in order to produce a
	    graphical representation of the calculated topologies.
	    see <http://www.boutell.com/gd>

For installation, please see INSTALL note.
